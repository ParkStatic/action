# Parkstatic Build and Deploy

GitHub Action to build and deploy your project to [Parkstatic](https://parkstatic.com).

## Prerequisites

- A [Parkstatic](https://parkstatic.com) instance
- Your Parkstatic secret stored as a repository secret named `PARKSTATIC_SECRET`

## Usage

Add a workflow file to your repository (for example `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: ParkStatic/parkstatic@v1
        with:
          parkstatic-secret: ${{ secrets.PARKSTATIC_SECRET }}
```

Pin to a specific release tag (for example `v1.0.0`) for reproducible builds.

## Hosting requirements

The deployed Lovable SPA expects to be served from the **root** of its domain (e.g. `https://customer.com/`). The Parkstatic action and WP plugin handle this case fully — all asset and HTML routing works automatically.

If the WordPress install lives at a subdirectory (`https://example.com/landing/`), the SPA's bundled React Router will not match the current URL because the SPA's source assumed `basename="/"`. Two workarounds:

- Run WordPress (and Parkstatic) at the root of your domain. Recommended.
- In your Lovable project, set Vite's `base` and your router's `basename` to the WordPress subdirectory path before deploying.

Static asset serving works on both root and subdirectory installs.

## How it works

1. Detects the package manager from your lockfile.
2. Installs your project's dependencies.
3. Runs your project's own `build` script — no overlay configs, no framework lock-in.
4. **Prerenders** the result by serving the build output locally and crawling it with headless Chromium. Every reachable route is written as a static `<path>/index.html`, giving SEO-friendly HTML for any router, framework, or Lovable variant.
5. Zips and uploads to your Parkstatic instance.
